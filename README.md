**Step 1: Background/Problem Definition** 
My personal experience with credit card fraud served as a catalyst for my interest in developing a robust credit card fraud detection system. Having encountered a situation where my credit card was compromised and used to pay off someone else's college tuition, I realized the stress that fraudulent transactions can have on individuals - contacting banks, providing proof of location, etc. While I support the pursuit of education, I found myself deeply frustrated by the violation of my financial security. 

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient credit card fraud detection system that operates in real-time. The system should **classify** incoming credit card transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The project will utilize historical credit card transaction data to train and evaluate the model. The focus will be on detecting unauthorized transactions and account takeovers. Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, techniques such as oversampling and undersampling will be employed to address class imbalance.

**Step 2: Data Collection** 
We are going to use a dataset available from kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

 - The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.  
- This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
- It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
-Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

**Step 3: Data Preprocessing**

-   Handle missing values and outliers.
-   Explore the class distribution (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions) to address class imbalance.
-   Normalize or standardize numerical features.
-   Encode categorical variables.

**Step 4: Feature Engineering**

-   Create relevant features that capture transaction behavior (e.g., transaction frequency, time since last transaction).
-   Compute aggregated features (e.g., rolling average transaction amount) over time windows.
-   Generate features that quantify relationships between transactions (e.g., deviations from usual transaction patterns).

**Step 5: Model Selection** Choose appropriate classification algorithms for fraud detection, such as:

-   Random Forest
-   Gradient Boosting
-   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-   Neural Networks (Deep Learning)

**Step 6: Model Training**

-   Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
-   Train the selected models using the training data.
-   Fine-tune hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search.

**Step 7: Model Evaluation**

-   Evaluate models on the validation set using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
-   Analyze the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

**Step 8: Model Interpretability**

-   Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or feature importance scores to understand which features contribute to fraud predictions.
-   Explainable AI techniques help build trust and compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Step 9: Threshold Setting** Determine an appropriate threshold for classification that balances precision and recall based on business needs and tolerances for false positives and false negatives.

**Step 10: Real-Time Prediction** Implement the trained model in a real-time production environment to process incoming credit card transactions.

**Step 11: Model Monitoring and Updating** Regularly monitor model performance to ensure its accuracy over time. If performance degrades, retrain the model with new data and updated features.

**Step 12: Reporting and Visualization** Create reports and dashboards summarizing the effectiveness of the fraud detection system. Visualize key metrics, trends, and anomalies for stakeholders.

**Step 13: Deployment** Deploy the fraud detection system to production, integrating it seamlessly into the transaction processing pipeline.

**Outcomes and Benefits:**

-   A robust credit card fraud detection system that identifies potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time.
-   Insights into transaction patterns and features that contribute to fraud predictions.
-   Demonstrated proficiency in end-to-end machine learning, from data preprocessing to deployment.
